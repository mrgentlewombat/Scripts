# Welcome

You are looking at my everyday scripts that I'm using on my linux machine.

## auto_mount

Simple script to automount your disks at startup, add the UUID and name you would like it to be mounted under to the `auto_mount.conf` file, and run the `deploy.sh` script.

To manually run the scripts after deploy, you can use the `wombat-mount` and `wombat-unmount` commands.
